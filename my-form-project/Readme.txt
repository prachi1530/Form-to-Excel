Hi

I will walk you through the demo of the form I have created.

  1. The form contains a field: email.
 
  2. If it is a new user, the email gets stored in the excel spreadsheet.   Also, it redirects to a webpage (which will be a detailed form later   on) saying it is a new user.

  3. If it is an existing user, the email does not get stored in the excel spreadsheet. Instead it redirects to a webpage (which will be a condensed form later on) saying it is an existing user.
